# Linux Lab Notes 🐧

## 🎯 About This Repository
This repository serves as a professional technical log of my journey mastering Linux as a primary workstation environment. Rather than just a collection of commands, these notes document the **why**, the **how**, and the **troubleshooting** involved in configuring a robust Linux-based workflow for engineering and development.

My goal is to demonstrate a systematic approach to system administration, software deployment, and environment optimization.
